MS-Windows notes
=================

  All the binaries in bin/ are for the Linux platform.  Check in the
bin/NT and bin/95 directories for the MS-Windows binaries.

~/bin/95/MORDOR.EXE is the standalone executable for both platforms.

~/bin/NT/MORDORNT.EXE is the NT service version and will only run as a
service on NT.  ~/bin/NT/SERVICE.EXE will install/uninstall the service
version into NT.

  Included in ~/bin/NT and ~/bin/95 are several utility programs for
Mordor.  Check in ~/docs for more information on each of them.


Playing with the Mordor Source Code
===================================
If you wish to play with the source yourself, a project file for
Microsoft's Visual C++ (Win32/NT) is also included. You can find it in
~/src.

        Have fun!

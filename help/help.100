Help on Social Commands:

	These commands enable you to role-play your character
much more effectively.  Many can take a monster or another
player as an object, and they allow you to interact in a
non-combat mode.  However, you should be careful using
some of them as a few of the commands can be seen as
offensive.  Improper use may result in an an upset fellow
player, or even a monster in some rare cases.
	For social commands that do not appear on this
list you may use the EMOTE command.  This will allow
you to customize your character's behavior.

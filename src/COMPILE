Compile-time options
====================

  Define the following in your Makefile or project file before compiling
to enable the following options (Win32 instructions below):


DMALLOC --  This is for serious debugging, or if you are interested in 
looking at the memory usage of Mordor.  You also need to install the 
associated library funxtions.  See http://www.letters.com/dmalloc for more 
information.
 
FREEBSD -- This is for FreeBSD systems.

IRIX -- This is for IRIX (Silicon Graphics) systems.  Mordor has been 
compiled under IRIX 5.3 on a number of SGI systems.

FINGERACCT -- This enables the *finger command for DMs.  You must have 
~/bin/fing compiled properly from ~/src/finger.c.  This option is not 
available on Win32 at this time.

COMPRESS -- This enables file and in memory compression.  It is on by
default and is recommended.

WIN32 -- Use this if you are compiling for Win95/NT.  A project file for
MSVC++ is included.

WINNT -- Use this as well as WIN32 if you are compiling for NT.

  Be sure to check out the online FAQ at http://mordor.nazgul.com if you 
have any questions.

Compile-time options
====================

  Define the following in your Makefile before compiling to enable the 
following options:


DMALLOC --  This is for serious debugging, or if you are interested in 
looking at the memory usage of Mordor.  You also need to install the 
associated library funxtions.  See http://www.letters.com for more 
information.
 
IRIX -- This is for IRIX (Silicon Graphics) systems.

PARANOID -- This will block access to all non-RFC1413 accounts.

CHECKDOUBLE -- This will enable a double log checking routine that used 
the files in ~/player/simul.  If you want to block double 
logging using this function you need to create files named 
after the character you wish to block double logging.  In 
the file put the other names of the persons characters.

RECORD_ALL -- This will output all the keystrokes by all players to 
~/log/all_cmd.

SECURE -- This will block access to broadcasting for all 
non-RFC1413 accounts that have not been authorized.  It will also prevent 
them from playing past level 3.

LASTCOMMAND -- This causes WHO to output all players last commands.

SUICIDE -- This keeps track of all suicided characters in ~/log/SUICIDE

COMPRESS -- This enables file compression.  It is on by default and is 
recommended.

FINGERACCT -- This enables the *finger command for DMs.  You must have 
~/bin/fing compiled properly from ~/src/finger.c.  This option is not 
available on Win95/NT at this time.

AUTOSHUTDOWN -- This enables automatic shutdowns of the program.

WIN32 -- Use this if you are compiling for Win95/NT.

GETHOSTBYNAME -- This enables the system call gethostbyname.

	Yes, there are bugs.  If you happen to find one, please let us
know (or even better -- send a patch) so that we can tell others who are 
running this same code.  You can send your bugs or patches to 
mordor@moria.bio.uci.edu or post them to rec.games.mud.admin.
	None of the bugs in this version of the code should do any damage 
to your system.  They may cause players or room files to be corrupted 
when frp crashes, so you should backup every now and then.

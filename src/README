  This should compile out of the box on Win95/NT, Linux, FreeBSD, IRIX,
ULTRIX, NeXT Mach or SunOS.  Be sure to take a look at mtype.h to define
your paths properly and to set your DMNAMES.  Also, check out the
COMPILE file for information on compile-time options.  Then just cd src/
and type make. You should have an executable file named mordor within a
few minutes. 
  If you prefer you can just run the executables provided for Win95/NT 
and Linux (in bin/).
  I know that the docs are lacking, and I am working on them.  Check the
Mordor web site for updates.  If you have questions post to
rec.games.mud.admin or rec.games.mud.misc.  There is also a listserver
available for Mordor administrators.  Send email to majordomo@gnt.net
with the words 'subscribe mordor_admins' in the body. 
  In addition you can check out our online documentation at:

Windows notes:
A project file for Microsoft's Visual C++ (Win32/NT) is also included.

~/bin/95/MORDOR.EXE is the standalone executable for both platforms.

~/bin/NT/MORDORNT.EXE is the NT service version and will only run as a
service on NT.  ~/bin/NT/SERVICE.EXE will install/uninstall the service
version into NT.

        Have fun!

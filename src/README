	This should compile out of the box on Linux, FreeBSD or SunOS.  Be
sure to take a look at mtype.h to define your paths properly and to set
your DMNAMES.  Then just cd src/ and type make.  You should have an
executable file named frp.new within a few minutes. 
	I know that the docs suck, but I am too lazy to write more.  If
you have questions post to rec.games.mud.admin or rec.games.mud.misc. 

	Have fun!

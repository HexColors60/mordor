  This should compile out of the box on Win95/NT, Linux, FreeBSD or SunOS. 
Be sure to take a look at mtype.h to define your paths properly and to set
your DMNAMES.  Also, check out the COMPILE file for information on
compile-time options.  Then just cd src/ and type make.  You should have
an executable file named frp.new within a few minutes.
  If you prefer you can just run the executables provided for Win95/NT 
and Linux (in bin/).  You will need to have the installation made in the 
/home/mordor path for Linux and in the /home/Isengard/mordor path for 
Win95/NT. 
  I know that the docs suck, but I am too busy to write more.  If
you have questions post to rec.games.mud.admin or rec.games.mud.misc, or

frp -- This is the game itself.  The version given has been compiled under
Linux 1.3.32.  If you have another OS, you will need to compile it
yourself.  Look in the src/ directory for more information.  
	You can call frp from a shell program if you like, or just from
the command line.  It accepts flags, with the two most important being the
port and the reuse command.  To run the game on a port other than the
default (4040) you can start it with: frp <port#>.
	If you are having trouble with it running try: 

			frp -r &  

	This will tell it to reuse the ports (we saw ocassional problems
with this under Linux 1.1.59). 
	Another common problem is that this distribution is installed in 
the improper place.  It *MUST* be installed in the paths defined in mtype.h	
(default is /home/mordor).

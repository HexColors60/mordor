Muddle
------

	Muddle is a MUD client written by Brett Vickers
(bvickers@ics.uci.edu).  It supports multiple connections, macros,
and limited bot capabilities.  Source code is included under the 
/home/mordor/muddle directory. 
	This program looks for a file named '.muddle' which configures 
your sites, macros, and bots.  Use the sample.muddle file as a template 
for your personalized .muddle.	
	If you find this program useful, drop Brett a note thanking him 
for his efforts.  If you have questions about this distribution, mail

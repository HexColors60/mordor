		Welcome to Mordor 2.5 Beta

	This package is a source distribution of Mordor v2.5 beta. The
database provided is a fraction of Isengard which is running at
128.200.21.101 4040 (moria.bio.uci.edu).  Packages can be gotten from
sunsite.unc.edu as /pub/Linux/games/muds/Mordor_2.x.tgz. 
	The code for this binary package was created by Brett J. Vickers, 
and expanded upon my Steve Smith and Brooke Paul.  The database is the 
work of several graduates students in the School of Biological Sciences 
at UCI.  Please read the disclaimer about its use and distribution.

DATABASE:
	You are encouraged to create your own scenarios, with or without
the portions provided.  There may be slight bugs in the database, as I
not-so-nicely dissected the city of Celduin for your use.  At the most you
will need to delete exits that lead off the map. 
	 The editor provides an easy way to create your world.  Just read
the documentaion provided in the help and docs directories, and you will
be on your way.
	When you first start up the game you will want to log in and
create the DM characters (telnet localhost 4040).  There are a limited
number of DMs and those have been defined at compilation.  You may create
as many caretakers as you wish by setting their class to 9.  The DM names
are set in the src/mtype.h file and default to the following:
			Garth
			Tesseract
			Boromir
			Bahamut
			Melkor
			Samwise
			Alice
	These are the only characters that will have FULL access to the DM
commands.  Caretakers can access around 70% of all DM commands. 
	If you are planning on running Mordor on a long-term basis, please
be sure to send in the registration form so we can let you know about 
updates and bug patches.
	
	When you get this running on your system, please email a note to
mordor@moria.bio.uci.edu.  If you have questions, post them to 
rec.games.mud.admin. 

	Good luck and we hope you enjoy Mordor!

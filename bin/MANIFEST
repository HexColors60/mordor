The following is the directory structure and files that you should 
have to run Mordor (NOTE:  Win95/NT users need to use the 
/home/mordor/Isengard path instead).

/home/mordor/bin:
	frp -- the driver for Linux
	auth -- authorizes the port for frp connections
	editor -- the database offline editor
	MORDOR.ZIP -- the driver for Win95/NT.

/home/mordor/rooms:
	Feel free to erase ours and begin your own world. If you wish you
can just add to the city of Ocenacrest as well.  Note:  You MUST have rooms
50 & 1 (limbo and the tree of life), though you can change their
properties. 

/home/mordor/objmon:
	All the objects and monsters information.  Talk contains the 
scripts for the interactive talking monsters, as well as the Logic Action 
Monsters.

/home/mordor/post:
	The game mail is held here.

/home/mordor/docs:
	Documentation on the DM commands and editor functions.

/home/mordor/help:
	The games help files are kept here.  There is some DM information 
here as well.

/home/mordor/log:
	The game log is kept here as well as the news file which is shown 
to all non-DM characters that log in.  The directory auth contains files 
for use by the auth program.

/home/mordor/player:
	The player files are all kept here.

/home/mordor/src:
	This is the source code for frp (the driver).

/home/mordor/util:
	This is source code for several useful utility programs.  You will
need the editor at least.

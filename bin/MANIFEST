	muddle -- a client written by Brett for use with muds

/home/mordor/rooms:
	You should have about 220 or so.  Feel free to erase ours and
begin your own world. If you wish you can just add to the city of Celduin
as well.  Note:  You MUST have rooms 50 & 1 (limbo and the tree of life), 
though you can change their properties.

to all non-DM characters that log in.  The directory auth contains files 
for use by the auth program.

DATABASE:
  You are encouraged to create your own scenarios, with or without
the portions provided.
  The editor provides an easy way to create your world.  Just read the
documentaion provided in the help and docs directories, and you will be on
your way.  
NOTE FOR WINDOWS95/NT USERS:  You need to add
device=C:/dos/ansi.sys to your autoexec.bat to use the editor. Check in 
the util/ed directory for source code and a Win95/NT binary.

  When you first start up the game you will want to log in and
create the DM characters (telnet localhost 4040).  There are a limited
number of DMs and those have been defined at compilation.  You may create
as many caretakers as you wish by setting their class to 11.  The DM names
are set in the src/mtype.h file and default to the following:
			Garth
			Tesseract
			Gandalf                     
			Ugluk
			Darwin
			Fangorn
			Frodo


  These are the only characters that will have FULL access to the DM
commands.  Caretakers can access around 70% of all DM commands. 
  If you are planning on running Mordor on a long-term basis, please
be sure to send in the registration form so we can let you know about 
updates and bug patches.
